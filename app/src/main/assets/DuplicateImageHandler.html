<h3 align="center">Duplicate Image Handler</h3>
<p align="left">Duplicate Image Handler is an app for finding duplicate images on your device and optionally deleting them. There are many such apps. Most look at all the images on the device, but will not let you limit the search to a single directory. When there are many images, this can be overwhelming and hard to navigate. Duplicate Image Handler gives you the option of doing either, the reason it was written. </p>
<p align="left">The interface is simple, and it  only does images. It may not work for some valid media image files, such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Photoshop (PSD), or empty files of any image type. It requires Android 11 (API 30). </p>
<p align="left">It works by reducing the image to an 8 x 8 grayscale Bitmap, calculating a 64 character string based on whether a pixel is greater than the average gray value or not, then comparing these strings using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a>. The images are obtained from the Android Media Store, and so will depend on what your device considers to be image media and whether a thumbnail can be obtained from the media found (why it may not work for SVG, PSD, and empty files).</p>
<p align="left"><a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a> are found at the end. </p>
<p>The interface consists of two screens:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#mainactivity">Main Screen </a></li>
  <li><a href="#groupactivity">Duplicates Screen</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 align="left"><a name="mainactivity" id="mainactivity"></a>Main  Screen </h3>
<p align="left">The main screen has a directory name, an ALL MEDIA button for choosing to search all media, a SELECT DIRECTORY button for setting a specific directory, and a check box for whether to include subdirectories of that specific directory.You commence the search by using the floating Find button. The following menu items are available. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Info</strong></p>
<p align="left">Shows information about the current directory choice and requested permissions and whether they have been granted or not. If you are not finding any images, you may not have set the required permission(s). </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Help</strong></p>
<p align="left">Brings up this page. </p>
<h4><strong>Choose Directory</strong></h4>
<p align="left">Brings up a system file chooser to choose the directory. This menu item does the same thing as the SELECT DIRECTORY button. </p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="groupactivity" id="groupactivity"></a>Duplicates Screen </h3>
<p align="left">The duplicates are presented on the Duplicates screen in groups of similar images. There is a thumbnail, the file name, its size, its full path, and a checkbox for whether you want to delete it or not. Tapping on the thumbnail will allow you to bring up the Gallery or another image handler on the image. Tapping the name, size, or path will bring up a dialog with more information on the image. The images in a group are sorted by the date taken with the newest at the top. The date taken comes from the metadata associated with the image (usually EXIF) and will not be defined if the image does not have metadata. There is still a tendency for newer images to be listed first. You can check by looking at the extra information obtained by clicking. The actual deleting is done via the menu. The following menu items are available.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Info</strong></p>
<p align="left">Gives a summary of the groups.  </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Delete Checked Images</strong></p>
<p align="left">Deletes the currently checked images and runs the find again.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Refresh</strong></p>
<p align="left">Does find images again. Use if, for example, you deleted an image in the Gallery. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Show Problem Images</strong></p>
<p align="left">Shows which images encountered errors, usually owing to there being no thumbnail.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="acknowledgements" id="acknowledgement"></a>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p align="left">This app was based on<a href="https://github.com/gavinliu/SimilarPhoto"> Similar Photo </a>by Liu Yunlong. That project was last updated in 2017, and was designed for Android 10 (API 25) and is hence out of date. It only finds images, does not delete them. The logic has been significantly changed and capability has been added, but its use of finding similar images via the Hamming distance is still used, as it seems to work well.</p>
<p align="left">Duplicate Image Handler uses <a href="https://github.com/bumptech/glide">Glide v4</a> to display the images. </p>
