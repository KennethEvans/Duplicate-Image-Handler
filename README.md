Duplicte Image Handler is an app for finding and deleting duplicate images in all images on the device or only in a specified directory. Most apps of this kind only find all the images on the device, which can be overwhelming to handle. It requires Android 11 (API 30).

See <https://kenevans.net/opensource/DuplicateImageHandler/Assets/DuplicateImageHandler.html> for more information.
